# ❧ A Call to Action ❧

You practice developer relations or developer marketing. Perhaps you’ve been doing it for a while, and want to share stories. Perhaps you are new and aren’t yet sure what it is you do. Either way, you have a story to share, and an urge to hear the stories of others. Same here; I’ve got a lot of questions, and a lot of stories.

Let’s you and me and the others do something together.

But not a meetup.

So let’s not. Let’s do something else instead. This started in Paris—let’s do something more egalitarian, something…I don't know, Parisian.

Like a salon. The salons of 17th and 18th century Paris were the most important forum for intellectual discourse of the era, and were the primary conduit for the Renaissance from Italy to the rest of Western Europe. This sounds fun.

What would a modern-day salon look like? More like an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rebeccabagley/2014/08/18/how-unconferences-unleash-innovative-ideas/#7069e618645b">unconference</a>. No fixed schedule, no lineup of speakers with prepared talks. Instead, we’ll come with topics that have been on our minds of late, and find people who want to discuss them.

There might be a topic of the month. There will be places to sit in quiet conversation with your peers, and meet new people. There will absolutely be a chance for you to be heard, and for you to learn from others, regardless of your ability or desires to get up in front of a room and speak.

What do you think? Will you come join us?
