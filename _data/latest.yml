content: <p>So. Much. Turkey. Let's face the new year and start planning our developer
  relations strategies, together. We'll gather and discuss what worked last year,
  and what didn't, and how we can do better this year. Come with a description of
  a challenge you faced, and how you faced it—whether you succeeded or failed, and
  let's all learn from each others' experience.</p> <p>Please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/devrel-salon-no-5-tickets-41794684025">RSVP</a>.
  We'll be there waiting for you.</p>
