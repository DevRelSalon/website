content: <p>Join us for Printemps et Peut Être Pétanque à Paris. Enjoy some quiet terrace space in the sweet weather of Paris's spring, social time with colleagues, and maybe we'll even throw heavy objects competitively. Of course there will be plenty of shop talk and networking with cool members of the DevRel community. Spots are limited, so be sure to <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Paris-DevRel-Salon/events/250873651/">RSVP</a>!</p>
