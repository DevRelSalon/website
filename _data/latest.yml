content: <p>This month, we return to Paris, and we're looking for a quieter, more intimate space for the next Salon, so we can talk—and be heard. This month's proposed topic? The CFP is open for DevXCon and DevRelCon! Let's help each other craft the perfect proposal—bring your topic, and pitch it to the group. Don't have a good idea for a talk, or aren't sure? Let us help you find your muse!</p>
  <p>Please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/devrel-salon-no-7-tickets-44476559587">RSVP</a>. We'll be there waiting for you.</p>
