content: <p>This month, we return to Paris, and we've found a quieter, more intimate space for the next Salon at Le Bloc, so we can talk—and be heard. This month's proposed topic? The CFP is open for DevXCon and DevRelCon! Let's help each other craft the perfect proposal—bring your topic, and pitch it to the group. Don't have a good idea for a talk, or aren't sure? Let us help you find your muse!</p>
  <p>Please <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/devrel-salon-no-7-tickets-44476559587">RSVP</a>. We'll be there waiting for you.</p>
