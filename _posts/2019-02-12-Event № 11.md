First off, thanks to everybody who came out: this was our best-attended meet-up of 2019 yet! Held at the [SFEIR](https://www.sfeir.com/) offices, just outside of Paris in Neuilly-sur-Seine, we had a great presentation by [J-F Garreau](https://twitter.com/jefbinomed) on the talk selection process for [DevFest Nantes](https://devfest.gdgnantes.com/). This was followed by a great discussion group around how to select events to sponsor (from the sponsor's perspective).
