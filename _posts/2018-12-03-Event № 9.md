After a lull, we have emerged invigorated and empowered heading into 2019 - and a big part of that new vision was our final event of 2018! For Salon № 9, we met at [Datadog (Paris)](https://www.datadoghq.com), and while surrounded by old friends and new faces, we discussed a tough but important topic: Ethics in Developer Relations. Following that round-table, the Paris DevRel Salon braintrust (now including [Dan "phrawzty" Maher](https://twitter.com/phrawzty)) agreed on a new format and rhythm for our 2019 meetups. All in all an important step forward for our burgeoning local community.
